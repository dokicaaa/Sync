<h1 align="left">Sync - A Minimal and Modern Chat App</h1>

###

<p align="left">A modern chat app with a minimal UI, featuring dark/light mode, profile uploading, image sharing, and more.</p>

### The idea behind the App

Sync was created with a focus on simplicity and functionality. The goal is to offer a chat experience that’s free from unnecessary features and clutter. Many apps today are packed with excessive features, making them harder to navigate and use. With Sync, I wanted to go in the opposite direction, building an app that’s minimalistic, intuitive, and user-friendly.

Every feature in Sync is designed to serve a purpose, making it easy for users to connect and share without being overwhelmed by options they don’t need. With essentials like dark/light mode, profile uploading, and image sharing and more, Sync provides a straightforward and enjoyable chat experience that users can rely on.
